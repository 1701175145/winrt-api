# Windows.Gaming.Input.IGameController

## -description
The core interface required to be implemented by all controller devices, regardless of their actual type (i.e. gamepads, steering wheels, flight sticks, etc). This interface exists mainly to support extensibility for game controllers, which allows OEMs to publish WinRT classes that provide rich access to their device's features, while integrating into the underlying game controller device enumeration framework.
