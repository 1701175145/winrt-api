# Windows.ApplicationModel.UserActivities.UserActivity

## -description

Provides information about a task the user is engaged in.

## -remarks

A **UserActivity** encapsulates a user's task that can be continued at a later time, and potentially on a different device.
For example, a mail app could create a **UserActivity** when the user starts creating a new email message. The user could pause working on the email and then work on it later on the same machine, or even another device.
