# Windows.Graphics.Display.BrightnessOverride.GetDefaultForSystem

## -description
Returns a brightness override object. This method does not require [CoreWindow](../windows.ui.core/corewindow.md) so it can be used by apps that are running in the background.

## -returns
The brightness override object.

## -remarks
Requires the __systemManagement__ capability to be declared in your app's package manifest. This capability allows apps to have basic system administration privileges. If it isnâ€™t declared, this method throws an access is denied exception. For more info, see [App capability declarations](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/packaging/app-capability-declarations#general-use-capabilities).
