An [IRemoteSystemFilter](iremotesystemfilter.md) that alters the set of discoverable remote systems by allowing those of a specific authorization kind.

The client device TBD - must be set for anonymous in order to discover cross-user. This is a device setting. The filter value does not set this. But the filter is also required to see Anonymous devices?
