## -description
Represents and handles a remote session that can be shared between two or more connected devices. See Remarks for information on this feature.

## -remarks
Remote System Sessions is a part of the broader Remote Systems feature set. It allows an app to establish a session object as an intermediate "third party" that two or more devices can continually communicate with and through, enabling a number of new cross-device scenarios, such as remote app messaging, TBD1. 

A session that has been joined is represented by a [**RemoteSystemSession**](RemoteSystemSession.md) object. A session that is known about but has not been joined is represented by a [**RemoteSystemSessionInfo**](RemoteSystemSessionInfo.md) object.
