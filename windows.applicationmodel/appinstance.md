# Windows.ApplicationModel.AppInstance

## -description
Represents an instance of an app. 

## -remarks
The system maintains a cache of app instances.
Apps can use this cache for redirection of an app when it attempts to activate. 
An app can activate a separate instance or redirect the activation to an existing instance. 

The shell can provide a preferred instance for redirection, but the app itself determines the actual activation.
