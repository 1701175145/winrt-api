Once an interaction has started, relative motions of the hand may be used to control the gesture, as with the Manipulation or Navigation gesture.This method will return null if the specified coordinate system cannot be located at the moment.## -parameters### -param coordinateSystemThe coordinate system in which to express the gaze.## -returnsThe gaze.## -remarks## -examples## -see-also
