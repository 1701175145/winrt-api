# Windows.ApplicationModel.Payments

## -description
This namespace provides payment functionality equivalent to the [W3C Payment Request API](https://aka.ms/prapi) specification for Universal Windows Platform (UWP) apps. The W3C Payment Request API allows websites to collect payment information in a way that is easy for both the merchant and the user.

To use the Payment Request API, you will need to support one of the existing payment methods. The [W3C Basic Card Payment](https://www.w3.org/TR/payment-method-basic-card/) is a payment method which is available in Windows and is easy to integrate into existing payment infrastructure.
