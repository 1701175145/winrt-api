---<!-- Property syntaxpublic Windows.Foundation.DateTime ExpirationTime { get; }--># Windows.Networking.PushNotifications.PushNotificationChannel.ExpirationTime## -descriptionGets the time at which the channel expires. Notifications sent to this channel after this time are rejected.## -property-valueThe time at which the channel expires. Notifications sent to this channel after this time are rejected.## -remarksTo prevent a channel from expiring, apps should request a new push notification channel every time that the app is run.An expired channel behaves as though it was closed. Because channels cannot be renewed, after a channel expires, a secondary tile or application must request a new push notification channel.<!-- @WRITER erictill 6/24/2011 :createPushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync -->## -examples## -see-also[Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) overview](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2125b09f-db90-4515-9aa6-516c7e9acccd), [Push and periodic notifications sample](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=231476), [Quickstart: Sending a tile push notification](XREF:TODO:m_ui_tiles.quickstart_sending_a_tile_push), [Quickstart: Sending a toast push notification](XREF:TODO:m_ui_tiles.quickstart_sending_a_toast_push), [How to update a badge through push notifications](XREF:TODO:m_ui_tiles.howto_update_badges_push), [How to authenticate with the Windows Push Notification Service (WNS)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/15975fe8-5e63-4d5d-b885-c4113c86b20e), [How to request, create, and save a notification channel](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/7aae5dbd-f03e-4cfa-bcf2-c9ad1d7cdb42), [Guidelines and checklist for push notifications](XREF:TODO:m_ui_tiles.guidelines_for_push_notifications), [Push notification service request and response headers](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/50575c54-b617-40c5-9dda-79a065e00cca)## -capabilitiesinternetClient
